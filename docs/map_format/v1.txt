The file begins with two 32bit unsiged ints storing
 respectively the map width and height. They are 
 referred to as w and h in the sources.

The rest of the file contains (w*h) bytes of data,
 each representing a value of the enum type Block.
They are directly stored in the map object's data,
 which is ordered line by line.
